# JS Design Pattern Exercises

This practice project is to create a foundational understanding of a few design patterns in JavaScript.
It is to move away from chaotic, unorganised "spaghetti code" to a more refined and standardised pattern of code design.

Target project:
A simple webpage that accepts an input from the user with a few methods to interact with the programme.

Objective:
To recreate the "spagehtti code" with the following design patterns:

- Object literal pattern
- Classes / constructors (classical OOP)
- Prototypal inheritance (prototypal OOP)
- Factory functions
- The module pattern
